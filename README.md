Demo Project to test different Android Architecture ideas

I took the idea of a very simple app from this article:

https://medium.com/google-developers/viewmodels-a-simple-example-ed5ac416317e

And use it to learn and understand more about:
- Clean Archiecture
- Android Architecture Components
- RxJava
- Testing

It would also be nice to:
- Improve the design
- Use Kotlin
